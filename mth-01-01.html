            “Help! A monster!” said Annie.<br>
            “Yeah, sure,” said Jack. “A real road in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.”<br>
            “Run, Jack!” said Annie. She <span class="clickable" data-meaning="경주하다">raced</span> up the road.<br>
            Jack <span class="clickable" data-meaning="기다리다">waited</span> for her.<br>
            “Come on, Jack, I’ll race you!” said Annie.<br>
            Jack <span class="clickable" data-meaning="부르다">called</span> out to her.<br>
            “No, thanks,” said Jack.<br>
            Annie raced along into the woods.<br>
            Jack looked at the sky. The sun was about to set.<br>
            “Come on, Annie! It’s time to go home!” yelled Jack.<br>
            But Annie didn’t answer.<br>
            Jack waited.<br>
            “Annie!” he <span class="clickable" data-meaning="부르다">called</span> again.<br>
            “Jack! Jack!” Annie <span class="clickable" data-meaning="소리쳤다">shouted</span>. “Come here! <span class="clickable" data-meaning="빠른">Quick</span>!”<br>
            Jack <span class="clickable" data-meaning="투덜거리다">groaned</span>. “This better be good,” he said.<br>
            Jack left the road and headed into the woods. The trees were lit with a <span class="clickable" data-meaning="황금색의">golden</span> <span class="clickable" data-meaning="늦은 오후">late-afternoon</span> <span class="clickable" data-meaning="빛">light</span>.<br>
            “Over here!” called Annie.<br>
            Annie was standing under a tall oak tree.<br>
            “Look!” she said. She pointed at a rope ladder.<br>
            It was hanging down from high in the tree.<br>
            “Wow,” Jack <span class="clickable" data-meaning="속삭이다">whispered</span>.<br>
            At the top of the tree was a tree house, <span class="clickable" data-meaning="밀어넣다, 숨기다">tucked</span> between two <span class="clickable" data-meaning="가지들">branches</span>.<br>
            “That must be the <span class="clickable" data-meaning="가장 높은">tallest</span> tree house in the world,” said Annie.<br>
            “Who built it?” asked Jack. “I’ve never seen it before.”<br>
            “I don’t know. But I’m going up,” said Annie.<br>
            “No! We don’t know who it belongs to,” said Jack.<br>
            “Just for a teeny minute,” said Annie. She started up the ladder.<br>
            “Annie, come back!” said Jack.<br>
            But Annie kept <span class="clickable" data-meaning="오르다">climbing</span>. She <span class="clickable" data-meaning="올라갔다">climbed</span> all the way up to the tallest <span class="clickable" data-meaning="가지들">branches</span>.<br>
            Jack sighed. “Annie, it’s almost dark! We have to go home!”<br>
            Annie <span class="clickable" data-meaning="사라지다">disappeared</span> inside the tree house.<br>
            “Annie!” Jack called.<br>
            Jack waited a moment. He was about to call again when Annie poked her <span class="clickable" data-meaning="머리">head</span> out of the tree house window.<br>
            “Books!” Annie <span class="clickable" data-meaning="소리쳤다">shouted</span>.<br>
            “What!” Jack said.<br>
            “It’s filled with books!” said Annie.<br>
            Oh, man! Jack <span class="clickable" data-meaning="생각하다">thought</span>. He loved books.<br>
            Jack pushed his glasses into place. He <span class="clickable" data-meaning="꽉 잡다">gripped</span> the sides of the rope ladder and started up.<br>
