    “<span class="vocab" data-meaning="도와줘! 🆘">Help</span>! A <span class="vocab" data-meaning="괴물 👹">monster</span>!” said Annie.<br>
    “Yeah, sure,” said Jack. “A real <span class="vocab" data-meaning="괴물 👹">monster</span> in Frog Creek, Pennsylvania.”<br>
    “<span class="vocab" data-meaning="달려! 🏃‍♂️">Run</span>, Jack!” said Annie.<br>
    She <span class="vocab" data-meaning="달렸다 🏃‍♀️">ran</span> up the road.<br>
    Oh, <span class="vocab" data-meaning="형/동생 😓">brother</span>, thought Jack. This is what he got for spending time with his seven-year-old sister.<br>
    Annie loved <span class="vocab" data-meaning="상상 놀이 🎭">pretend stuff</span>. But Jack was eight and a half. He liked <span class="vocab" data-meaning="진짜 것들 🎯">real things</span>.<br>
    “Watch out, Jack! The <span class="vocab" data-meaning="괴물 👹">monster</span>’s coming!” said Annie.<br>
    Jack didn’t say anything.<br>
    “Come on, Jack, I’ll <span class="vocab" data-meaning="경주하다 🏃‍♀️">race</span> you!” said Annie.<br>
    “No, thanks,” said Jack.<br>
    Annie <span class="vocab" data-meaning="달렸다 🏃‍♀️">raced</span> along into the <span class="vocab" data-meaning="숲 🌲">woods</span>.<br>
    Jack looked at the <span class="vocab" data-meaning="하늘 🌤️">sky</span>. The <span class="vocab" data-meaning="해 🌇">sun</span> was about to <span class="vocab" data-meaning="지다 🌄">set</span>.<br>
    “Come on, Annie! It’s time to go <span class="vocab" data-meaning="집 🏠">home</span>!” yelled Jack.<br>
    But Annie didn’t answer.<br>
    Jack waited.<br>
    “Annie!” he called again.<br>
    “Jack! Jack!” Annie shouted. “Come here! Quick!”<br>
    Jack <span class="vocab" data-meaning="신음하다 😩">groaned</span>. “This better be good,” he said.<br>
    Jack left the <span class="vocab" data-meaning="도로 🛣️">road</span> and headed into the <span class="vocab" data-meaning="숲 🌲">woods</span>. The trees were lit with a <span class="vocab" data-meaning="황금빛 🌅">golden</span> late-afternoon light.<br>
    “Over here!” called Annie.<br>
    Annie was standing under a tall <span class="vocab" data-meaning="참나무 🌳">oak tree</span>.<br>
    “Look!” she said. She pointed at a rope <span class="vocab" data-meaning="사다리 🪜">ladder</span>.<br>
    It was hanging down from high in the <span class="vocab" data-meaning="나무 🌳">tree</span>.<br>
    “Wow,” Jack whispered.<br>
    At the top of the tree was a <span class="vocab" data-meaning="나무집 🛖">tree house</span>, <span class="vocab" data-meaning="끼워져 있는 📦">tucked</span> between two branches.<br>
    “That must be the highest <span class="vocab" data-meaning="나무집 🛖">tree house</span> in the world,” said Annie.<br>
    “Who built it?” asked Jack. “I’ve never seen it before.”<br>
    “I don’t know. But I’m going up,” said Annie.<br>
    “No! We don’t know who it belongs to,” said Jack.<br>
    “Just for a <span class="vocab" data-meaning="조금만 ✋">teeny</span> minute,” said Annie. She started up the <span class="vocab" data-meaning="사다리 🪜">ladder</span>.<br>
    “Annie, come back!” said Jack.<br>
    But Annie kept <span class="vocab" data-meaning="오르다 🧗‍♀️">climbing</span>. She climbed all the way up to the tallest branches.<br>
    Jack <span class="vocab" data-meaning="한숨 쉬다 😮‍💨">sighed</span>. “Annie, it’s almost <span class="vocab" data-meaning="어두워지는 시간 🌆">dark</span>! We have to go home!”<br>
    Annie <span class="vocab" data-meaning="사라지다 🫥">disappeared</span> inside the <span class="vocab" data-meaning="나무집 🛖">tree house</span>.<br>
    “Annie!” Jack called.<br>
    Jack waited a moment. He was about to call again when Annie <span class="vocab" data-meaning="고개를 내밀다 🙋‍♀️">poked</span> her head out of the <span class="vocab" data-meaning="창문 🪟">window</span>.<br>
    “<span class="vocab" data-meaning="책들 📚">Books</span>!” Annie shouted.<br>
    “What!” Jack said.<br>
    “It’s filled with <span class="vocab" data-meaning="책들 📚">books</span>!” said Annie.<br>
    Oh, man! Jack thought. He loved <span class="vocab" data-meaning="책들 📚">books</span>.<br>
    Jack pushed his <span class="vocab" data-meaning="안경 👓">glasses</span> into place. He <span class="vocab" data-meaning="잡다 ✋">gripped</span> the sides of the rope ladder and started up.
