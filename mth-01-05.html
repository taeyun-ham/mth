  <h2>Chapter Five: Gold in the Grass</h2>

    "Go! Go!" said Jack. He threw his <span class="vocab" data-meaning="공책 📓 메모용 책자">notebook</span> into his <span class="vocab" data-meaning="가방 🎒 배낭 또는 책가방">pack</span>. He pushed Annie toward the <span class="vocab" data-meaning="밧줄 사다리 🪜 흔들리는 사다리">rope ladder</span>.<br>
    "Bye, Henry!" she said.<br>
    "Go!" said Jack. He gave Annie a big push.<br>
    "Quit it!" she said. But she started up the ladder. Jack <span class="vocab" data-meaning="기어올랐다 🧗‍♂️ 손과 발로 올라가기">scrambled</span> after her.<br>
    They <span class="vocab" data-meaning="굴러들어갔다 🌀 빠르게 안으로 들어감">tumbled</span> into the <span class="vocab" data-meaning="나무 위 집 🌳🏠">tree house</span>.<br>
    They were <span class="vocab" data-meaning="헐떡였다 😮 숨이 찬 상태">panting</span> as they looked out the window at the dinosaur.<br>
    He was standing on the <span class="vocab" data-meaning="언덕 꼭대기 🏞️ 높은 곳">hilltop</span>, eating flowers off a tree.<br>
    "Oh, man," <span class="vocab" data-meaning="속삭였다 🤫 작은 소리로 말함">whispered</span> Jack. "We are in a time long ago!"<br>
    The dinosaur looked like a huge <span class="vocab" data-meaning="코뿔소 🦏 무거운 동물">rhinoceros</span>. Only he had three <span class="vocab" data-meaning="뿔 🦄 머리 위 돌출 부분">horns</span> instead of one.<br>
    Two long ones above his eyes and one on his nose. He had a big shield-like thing behind his head.<br>
    "<span class="vocab" data-meaning="공룡 이름 🦕 세 개의 뿔이 있는 공룡">Triceratops</span>!" said Jack.<br>
    "Does he eat people?" whispered Annie.<br>
    "I'll look it up." Jack <span class="vocab" data-meaning="잡았다 ✊ 손에 쥐다">grabbed</span> the dinosaur book. He <span class="vocab" data-meaning="휙휙 넘겼다 📖 빠르게 책장을 넘기다">flipped</span> through the pages.<br>
    "There!" he said. He pointed to a picture of a Triceratops.<br>
    He read the <span class="vocab" data-meaning="설명문 📝 사진 밑에 설명하는 글">caption</span>:<br>
    The Triceratops lived in the late Cretaceous period. This plant-eating dinosaur weighed over 12,000 pounds.<br>
    Jack <span class="vocab" data-meaning="세게 닫았다 📚 꽝 하고 닫는 소리">slammed</span> the book shut. "Just plants. No meat."
    "Let's go see him," said Annie.<br>
    He <span class="vocab" data-meaning="밀어 넣었다 🎒 안에 쑥 넣기">shoved</span> the dinosaur book into his pack. He <span class="vocab" data-meaning="어깨에 멨다 👜 가방을 멘 동작">slung</span> it over his shoulder and started down the ladder.<br>
    On the way down, Jack <span class="vocab" data-meaning="멈췄다 🛑 중단했다">stopped</span>.<br>
    He called up to Annie, "Just promise you won't <span class="vocab" data-meaning="쓰다듬다 🤲 만지다">pet</span> him."
    "I promise."
    "Promise you won't <span class="vocab" data-meaning="키스하다 😘 입맞춤하다">kiss</span> him."
    "I promise."
    "Promise you won't <span class="vocab" data-meaning="말하다 💬 이야기하다">talk</span> to him."
    "I promise."
    "Promise you won't—"
    "Go! Go!" she said.
    Jack went.<br>
    Annie followed.<br>
    When they stepped off the ladder, the Pteranodon gave them a <span class="vocab" data-meaning="친절한 🥰 상냥한">kind</span> look.<br>
    Annie blew a kiss at him. "Be back soon, Henry," she said <span class="vocab" data-meaning="기분 좋게 😊 행복하게">cheerfully</span>.<br>
    "Shush!" said Jack. And he led the way through the <span class="vocab" data-meaning="양치류 식물 🌿 고사리 종류">ferns</span>. Slowly and <span class="vocab" data-meaning="조심스럽게 👣 신중하게">carefully</span>.<br>
    When he reached the bottom of the hill, he <span class="vocab" data-meaning="무릎을 꿇다 🙇 바닥에 앉는 자세">kneeled</span> behind a fat <span class="vocab" data-meaning="덤불 🌳 나무 숲 덤불">bush</span>.<br>
    Annie knelt beside him and started to speak.<br>
    "Shush!" Jack put his finger to his lips.<br>
    Annie made a face.<br>
    Jack <span class="vocab" data-meaning="몰래 보다 👀 슬쩍 보다">peeked</span> out at the Triceratops.<br>
    The dinosaur was incredibly big. Bigger than a truck. He was eating the flowers off a <span class="vocab" data-meaning="목련 나무 🌸 향기로운 꽃이 피는 나무">magnolia tree</span>.<br>
    Jack <span class="vocab" data-meaning="꺼냈다 🖊️ 가방에서 꺼내다">slipped</span> his notebook out of his pack.<br>
    He wrote: eats flowers<br>
    Annie <span class="vocab" data-meaning="쿡 찔렀다 🖐️ 팔꿈치로 찌르기">nudged</span> him.<br>
    Jack <span class="vocab" data-meaning="무시했다 🙈 반응하지 않음">ignored</span> her. He studied the Triceratops again.<br>
    He wrote: eats slowly<br>
    Annie nudged him hard.<br>
    Jack looked at her.<br>
    Annie pointed to herself. She walked her fingers through the air.<br>
    She pointed to the dinosaur. She smiled.<br>
    Was she <span class="vocab" data-meaning="놀리는 중 😂 장난치는 행동">teasing</span>?<br>
    She waved at Jack.<br>
    Jack started to grab her.<br>
    She laughed and jumped away. She fell into the grass. In full view of the Triceratops!<br>
    "Get back!" whispered Jack.<br>
    Too late. The big dinosaur had spotted Annie.<br>
    He <span class="vocab" data-meaning="응시했다 👀 바라보다">gazed</span> down at her from the hilltop. Half of a magnolia flower was sticking out of his mouth.<br>
    "Oops," said Annie.<br>
    "Get back!" Jack shouted at her.<br>
    "He looks nice, Jack."
    "Nice? Watch out for his horns, Annie!"
    "No. He's nice, Jack."
    Nice?<br>
    But the Triceratops just gazed calmly down at Annie.<br>
    Then he turned and <span class="vocab" data-meaning="성큼성큼 걸어갔다 🚶 느긋하게 걸어가는 모습">loped</span> away. Down the side of the hill.<br>
    "Bye!" said Annie. She turned back to Jack. "See?"
    Jack <span class="vocab" data-meaning="투덜거렸다 😒 작게 불평하다">grunted</span>. But he wrote in his notebook: nice<br>
    "Come on. Let's look around some more," said Annie.<br>
    As Jack started after Annie, he saw something <span class="vocab" data-meaning="반짝였다 ✨ 빛나는 느낌">glittering</span> in the tall grass. He reached out and picked it up.<br>
    A <span class="vocab" data-meaning="메달 🏅 동그란 금속 장식">medallion</span>. A gold medallion.<br>
    A letter was <span class="vocab" data-meaning="새겨져 있었다 ✒️ 조각되다">engraved</span> on the medallion. A fancy <span class="vocab" data-meaning="알파벳 M 🔤 머리글자">M</span>.<br>
    "Oh, man. Someone came here before us," Jack said softly.
