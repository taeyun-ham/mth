  <h2>Chapter Four: Henry</h2>
  <p>
    Jack <span class="vocab" data-meaning="숨을 헐떡였다 😲 놀라움이나 충격">gasped</span> as Annie held out her hand.<br>
    Oh, brother. She was always trying to make friends with <span class="vocab" data-meaning="동물 🐾">animals</span>.<br>
    But this was going too far.<br>
    "Don’t get too close to him, Annie!" Jack <span class="vocab" data-meaning="소리쳤다 📣 크게 말하다">shouted</span>.<br>
    But Annie <span class="vocab" data-meaning="만졌다 ✋ 손으로 건드렸다">touched</span> the Pteranodon’s <span class="vocab" data-meaning="볏 🐓 머리 위 뾰족한 부분">crest</span>. She <span class="vocab" data-meaning="쓰다듬었다 🖐️ 부드럽게 만지다">stroked</span> his neck.<br>
    She was <span class="vocab" data-meaning="말하고 있었다 💬 대화 중">talking</span> to him.<br>
    What in the world was she saying?<br>
    Jack took a <span class="vocab" data-meaning="숨을 깊게 쉬다 😮‍💨 마음 가라앉히는 호흡">deep breath</span>. Okay.<br>
    He would go down, too. It would be good to <span class="vocab" data-meaning="조사하다 🔍 살펴보다">examine</span> the creature. Take notes. Like a <span class="vocab" data-meaning="과학자 🔬 연구하는 사람">scientist</span>.<br>
    Jack started down the <span class="vocab" data-meaning="밧줄 사다리 🪜 흔들리는 사다리">rope ladder</span>.<br>
    When he got to the ground, Jack was only a few feet away from the creature.<br>
    The creature <span class="vocab" data-meaning="응시했다 👁️ 주의 깊게 바라보다">stared</span> at Jack. His eyes were bright and <span class="vocab" data-meaning="경계하는 🧐 집중하고 주의하는 상태">alert</span>.<br>
    "He’s <span class="vocab" data-meaning="부드러운 🧸 촉감이 부드러움">soft</span>, Jack," said Annie. "He feels like Henry."
    Jack <span class="vocab" data-meaning="콧웃음 쳤다 😤 비웃는 듯한 태도">snorted</span>. "He’s no dog, Annie."
    "Feel him, Jack," said Annie.
    Jack didn’t move.
    "Don’t think, Jack. Just do it."
    Jack <span class="vocab" data-meaning="한 걸음 내딛다 👣 앞으로 나아가다">stepped forward</span>. He put out his arm. Very <span class="vocab" data-meaning="조심스럽게 🐢 아주 주의 깊게">cautiously</span>. He <span class="vocab" data-meaning="손으로 스치다 🤲 살짝 만지는 행동">brushed</span> his hand down the creature’s neck.
    Interesting. A thin layer of <span class="vocab" data-meaning="잔털 🐥 작고 부드러운 털">fuzz</span> covered the Pteranodon’s skin.
    "Soft, huh?" said Annie.
    Jack reached into his <span class="vocab" data-meaning="가방 🎒 메는 가방">backpack</span> and pulled out a <span class="vocab" data-meaning="연필 ✏️ 글을 쓰는 도구">pencil</span> and a <span class="vocab" data-meaning="공책 📓 글 적는 책">notebook</span>.
    He wrote: fuzzy skin.
    "What are you doing?" asked Annie.
    "Taking <span class="vocab" data-meaning="노트 📖 중요한 점을 적는 것">notes</span>," said Jack. "We’re probably the first people in the whole world to ever see a real live Pteranodon."
    Jack looked at the Pteranodon again.
    The creature had a <span class="vocab" data-meaning="뼈가 있는 볏 🦴 단단한 부분">bony crest</span> on top of his head. The crest was longer than Jack’s arm.
    "I wonder how <span class="vocab" data-meaning="영리한 🧠 똑똑한">smart</span> he is," Jack said.
    "Very smart," said Annie.
    "Don’t count on it," said Jack. "His brain’s probably no bigger than a <span class="vocab" data-meaning="콩 🌱 아주 작은 씨앗">bean</span>."
    "No, he’s very smart. I can feel it," said Annie. "I’m going to call him Henry."
    Jack wrote in his notebook: small brain?
    Jack looked at the creature again. "Maybe he’s a <span class="vocab" data-meaning="돌연변이 🧬 특별히 변이된 생명체">mutant</span>," he said.
    The creature <span class="vocab" data-meaning="기울였다 🤔 고개를 옆으로 돌리다">tilted</span> his head.
    Annie <span class="vocab" data-meaning="웃었다 😄 재미있거나 귀여워서 반응함">laughed</span>. "He’s no mutant, Jack."
    "Well, what’s he doing here then? Where is this place?" said Jack.
    Annie <span class="vocab" data-meaning="기댔다 🤗 가까이 다가가다">leaned</span> close to the Pteranodon.
    "Do you know where we are, Henry?" she asked <span class="vocab" data-meaning="부드럽게 🐾 조용하고 상냥하게">softly</span>.
    The creature <span class="vocab" data-meaning="고정했다 👀 한곳을 응시하다">fixed</span> his eyes on Annie. His long jaws were opening and closing. Like a giant pair of <span class="vocab" data-meaning="가위 ✂️ 물건을 자르는 도구">scissors</span>.
    "Are you trying to talk to me, Henry?" asked Annie.
    "Forget it, Annie." Jack wrote in his notebook: mouth like scissors?
    "Did we come to a time long ago, Henry?" asked Annie. "Is this a place from long ago?" Suddenly she <span class="vocab" data-meaning="숨을 헐떡였다 😲 깜짝 놀라다">gasped</span>.
    "Jack!"
    He <span class="vocab" data-meaning="올려다봤다 👁️ 위를 보다">looked up</span>.
    Annie was pointing toward the <span class="vocab" data-meaning="언덕 🏞️ 작은 산처럼 생긴 지형">hill</span>. On top stood a <span class="vocab" data-meaning="거대한 공룡 🦕 매우 큰 고대 생물">huge dinosaur</span>!
