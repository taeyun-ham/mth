<h2>Chapter Two: The Monster</h2>
<p>
  Jack <span class="word">crawled<span class="tooltip">기어갔다</span></span> into the tree house.<br>
  "Wow," he said. The tree house was filled with <span class="word">books<span class="tooltip">책들</span></span>.<br>
  Books were <span class="word">everywhere<span class="tooltip">온 사방에</span></span> - very old books with <span class="word">dusty<span class="tooltip">먼지 낀</span></span> covers and new books with <span class="word">shiny<span class="tooltip">반짝이는</span></span>, <span class="word">bright<span class="tooltip">밝은</span></span> covers.<br><br>

  "Look," said Annie. "You can see far away."<br>
  She was <span class="word">peering<span class="tooltip">유심히 들여다봤다</span></span> out the tree house <span class="word">window<span class="tooltip">창문</span></span>.<br>
  Jack looked out the window with her.<br>
  Below were the tops of the other <span class="word">trees<span class="tooltip">나무들</span></span>.<br>
  In the <span class="word">distance<span class="tooltip">멀리</span></span> he could see the Frog Creek <span class="word">library<span class="tooltip">도서관</span></span>, the elementary <span class="word">school<span class="tooltip">학교</span></span>, and the <span class="word">park<span class="tooltip">공원</span></span>.<br><br>

  Annie pointed in the other <span class="word">direction<span class="tooltip">방향</span></span>.<br>
  "There's our <span class="word">house<span class="tooltip">집</span></span>," she said.<br>
  Jack could see their white wooden house with its green <span class="word">porch<span class="tooltip">현관</span></span>.<br>
  In the <span class="word">yard<span class="tooltip">마당</span></span> next was their neighbor's black <span class="word">dog<span class="tooltip">개</span></span>, Henry. He looked very <span class="word">tiny<span class="tooltip">작은</span></span>.<br><br>

  "Hi, Henry!" shouted Annie.<br>
  "Shush! We're not supposed to be up here," said Jack.<br>
  Jack <span class="word">glanced<span class="tooltip">훑어보다</span></span> around the tree house again.<br>
  He noticed that <span class="word">bookmarks<span class="tooltip">책갈피들</span></span> were sticking out of many of the books.<br>
  "I wonder who <span class="word">owns<span class="tooltip">가지고 있는</span></span> all these books," he said.<br><br>

  "I like this one," said Annie. She picked up a book with a <span class="word">castle<span class="tooltip">성</span></span> on the cover.<br>
  "Here's a book about <span class="word">Pennsylvania<span class="tooltip">펜실베니아 (미국 주)</span></span>," said Jack.<br>
  He turned to the page with the bookmark.<br>
  "Hey, here's a picture of Frog Creek," said Jack. "It's a picture of these woods!"<br><br>

  "Oh, here's a book for you," said Annie.<br>
  She held up a book about <span class="word">dinosaurs<span class="tooltip">공룡들</span></span>.<br>
  A blue silk bookmark was sticking out of it.<br>
  "Let me see," said Jack.<br>
  He set his <span class="word">backpack<span class="tooltip">가방</span></span> down on the floor and <span class="word">grabbed<span class="tooltip">잡았다</span></span> the book from Annie.<br><br>

  Jack opened the dinosaur book to the place where the bookmark was.<br>
  He turned to a picture of an ancient flying <span class="word">reptile<span class="tooltip">파충류</span></span>.<br>
  He recognized it as a <span class="word">Pteranodon<span class="tooltip">프테라노돈 (익룡)</span></span>.<br>
  He touched the huge <span class="word">bat-like<span class="tooltip">박쥐처럼 생긴</span></span> <span class="word">wings<span class="tooltip">날개</span></span> in the picture.<br>
  "Wow," whispered Jack. "I wish we could go to the time of Pteranodons."<br><br>

  Jack studied the picture of the <span class="word">odd-looking<span class="tooltip">이상하게 생긴</span></span> creature <span class="word">soaring<span class="tooltip">날아오르는</span></span> through the <span class="word">sky<span class="tooltip">하늘</span></span>.<br>
  "Ahhh!" screamed Annie.<br>
  "What!" said Jack.<br>
  "A <span class="word">monster<span class="tooltip">괴물</span></span>!" Annie cried. She pointed out the window.<br>
  Jack looked out the window.<br>
  A <span class="word">giant<span class="tooltip">거대한</span></span> creature was <span class="word">gliding<span class="tooltip">미끄러지듯 날다</span></span> above the <span class="word">treetops<span class="tooltip">나무 꼭대기</span></span>!<br>
  It had a long, <span class="word">weird<span class="tooltip">이상한</span></span> <span class="word">crest<span class="tooltip">볏</span></span> on the back of its head, a skinny <span class="word">beak<span class="tooltip">부리</span></span>, and huge bat-like wings!<br>
  It was a real live Pteranodon!<br>
  The creature <span class="word">swooped<span class="tooltip">휙 날아왔다</span></span> through the sky.<br>
  It looked like a <span class="word">glider<span class="tooltip">활공기</span></span> <span class="word">plane<span class="tooltip">비행기</span></span>!<br>
  It was coming straight toward the tree house!<br>
  "Get down!" cried Annie.<br>
  Jack and Annie <span class="word">crouched<span class="tooltip">쭈그려 앉았다</span></span> on the floor.<br>
  The <span class="word">wind<span class="tooltip">바람</span></span> started to blow.<br>
  The tree house started to <span class="word">spin<span class="tooltip">빙글빙글 돌다</span></span>.<br>
  It spun faster and faster.<br>
  Then everything was <span class="word">still<span class="tooltip">조용해졌다</span></span>.<br>
  Absolutely still.
