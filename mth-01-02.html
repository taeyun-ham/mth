  <h1>Chapter Two: The Monster</h1>
  <p>
    Jack <span class="word" data-word="crawl">crawled</span> into the tree house.<br>
    “Wow,” he said. The tree house was filled with <span class="word" data-word="book">books</span>.<br>
    Books were everywhere - very old books with <span class="word" data-word="dusty">dusty</span> covers and new books with <span class="word" data-word="shiny">shiny</span>, <span class="word" data-word="bright">bright</span> covers.<br>
    “Look,” said Annie. “You can see far away.”<br>
    She was <span class="word" data-word="peer">peering</span> out the tree house window.<br>
    Jack looked out the window with her.<br>
    Below were the tops of the other <span class="word" data-word="tree">trees</span>.<br>
    In the distance he could see the Frog Creek <span class="word" data-word="library">library</span>, the <span class="word" data-word="school">school</span> and the <span class="word" data-word="park">park</span>.<br>
    Annie pointed in the other direction. “There’s our <span class="word" data-word="house">house</span>,” she said.<br>
    Jack could see their white wooden house with its green <span class="word" data-word="porch">porch</span>.<br>
    In the yard was their neighbor’s black <span class="word" data-word="dog">dog</span>.<br>
    “Hi, Henry!” shouted Annie.<br>
    “<span class="word" data-word="shush">Shush</span>! We’re not supposed to be up here,” said Jack.<br>
    Jack <span class="word" data-word="glance">glanced</span> around the tree house again.<br>
    He noticed <span class="word" data-word="bookmark">bookmarks</span> were sticking out of many of the books.<br>
    “I <span class="word" data-word="wonder">wonder</span> who owns all these books,” he said.<br>
    “I like this one,” said Annie. She picked up a book with a <span class="word" data-word="castle">castle</span> on the cover.<br>
    “Here’s a book about Pennsylvania,” said Jack. He turned to the page with the bookmark.<br>
    “Hey, here’s a <span class="word" data-word="picture">picture</span> of Frog Creek,” said Jack. “It’s a picture of these woods!”<br>
    “Here’s a book for you,” said Annie. She held up a book about <span class="word" data-word="dinosaur">dinosaurs</span>.<br>
    A blue silk bookmark was sticking out of it.<br>
    “Let me see,” said Jack. He set his <span class="word" data-word="backpack">backpack</span> down on the floor and grabbed the book from Annie.<br>
    Jack opened the dinosaur book to the place where the bookmark was.<br>
    Jack turned to a picture of an ancient flying <span class="word" data-word="reptile">reptile</span>.<br>
    He recognized it as a <span class="word" data-word="pteranodon">Pteranodon</span>. He touched the huge <span class="word" data-word="wing">bat-like wings</span>.<br>
    “Wow,” <span class="word" data-word="whisper">whispered</span> Jack. “I wish we could go to the time of Pteranodons.”<br>
    Jack studied the picture of the <span class="word" data-word="odd">odd</span>-looking creature <span class="word" data-word="soar">soaring</span> through the sky.<br>
    “Ahhh!” screamed Annie.<br>
    “What?” said Jack.<br>
    “A <span class="word" data-word="monster">monster</span>!” Annie cried.<br>
    Jack looked out the window. A <span class="word" data-word="giant">giant</span> creature was <span class="word" data-word="glide">gliding</span> above the <span class="word" data-word="treetop">treetops</span>!<br>
    It had a long, <span class="word" data-word="weird">weird</span> crest, a skinny <span class="word" data-word="beak">beak</span>, and huge wings!<br>
    It was a real live Pteranodon!<br>
    “<span class="word" data-word="get down">Get down</span>!” cried Annie.<br>
    Jack and Annie <span class="word" data-word="crouch">crouched</span> on the floor.<br>
    The wind started to <span class="word" data-word="blow">blow</span>.<br>
    The tree house started to <span class="word" data-word="spin">spin</span>. It spun faster and faster.<br>
    Then everything was <span class="word" data-word="still">still</span>. <span class="word" data-word="absolutely">Absolutely</span> still.
